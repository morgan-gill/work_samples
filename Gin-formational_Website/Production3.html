        <h2 class="materialsh2">Step One:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">First you must add your grains (barley in this case), distilled water and yeast into a “Fermenter.” This will produce a mixture called “Mash.” The yeast will consume the sugars in the mash and convert it into alcohol. After a period of between three to seven days (depending on the size of your batch) the alcohol content will reach ideal levels for distillation.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/distilling_pot.jpg">
        <h2 class="materialsh2">Step Two:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">Second, you must transfer your mash into the pot of the still manually or by using a pump. Heat the still to the desired boiling point. That’s 173°F or roughly 78.3°C. Once this temperature is reached the alcohol in the mash will begin to evaporate and form vapour. </p>

        <img src="/assets/img/distillation_column.jpg">
        <h2 class="materialsh2">Step Three:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">Once the alcohol begins to boil off of your mash it will begin to rise. The vapour will climb up the “Distillation Column.” As the alcohol climbs the column, pressure will force it down the “Lyne Arm.” The lyne arm connects to the “Condenser.” The condenser is a coiled pipe containing the alcohol vapour surrounded by cool water. As the alcohol vapour cools, it condenses back into a liquid and flows the rest of the way down the condenser.</p>

        <h2 class="materialsh2">Step Four:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">You must now collect the “Distillate,” or the fluid leaving the condenser using a sanitary vessel. A jar, a pot or even a bucket will do. It’s important to note that the first portions of the fluid leaving the condenser will be the “head” of the distillate. The head contains many chemical compounds, some of which are strong in flavour, pungent or even poisonous. The head makes up roughly the first 5% of the distillate. The rest of the fluid leaving the condenser is the “heart.” A small amount of the head is usually mixed back in with the heart to add flavour. Too much head and the liquid will taste rough, bitter or foul. Too little head and the liquid will taste bland.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/sieveIndustrial.jpg">
        <h2 class="materialsh2">Step Five:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">Now your distillate must be redistilled with one major difference. You must place a sieve between the pot of your still and the distillation column. Fill the sieve with your flavouring ingredients (this is where the juniper berries come into play). When the alcohol vapour rises up the column it will pass through the sieve and carry many of the compounds and flavours from the flavouring ingredients with it. The most prominent flavour present in the distillate must be the flavour of the juniper berries.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/distiledWater.jpg">
        <h2 class="materialsh2">Step Six:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">After this second distillation, you will likely be left with a liquid that is roughly 70% alcohol or higher. Add distilled water to your new distillate until you reach the desired alcohol content. At this point, only distilled water can be added to the mixture. You will have to reach an alcohol content of between 37.5% and 50% for your spirit to be legally recognised as gin.</p>
