        <div class="icebraker">This page goes over some of the ingredients and equipment used in the production process of Gin. Several common ingredients have been listed as "optional," as they are not absolutely necessary. Never the less, many brewers add them to the spirit as they believe that they enhance the flavour of the finished product.

        <h2 class="materialsh2">Distilled Water:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">Clean distilled water will provide a good medium for the barley grains to mix and release their sugars. This will provide an ideal environment for the yeast to consume the sugars, produce alcohol and multiply.</p>

        <h2 class="materialsh2">Yeast:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">Yeast is a type of fungus that is vital to the brewing process. Yeast will consume carbohydrates (complex sugars) and produce a mix of both carbon dioxide and alcohol. The alcohol that the yeast produces is a special type of alcohol known as ethanol.</p>

        <h2 class="materialsh2">Sieve:</h2>
        <p class="materialsp">The sieve is used to hold your flavouring ingredients during the distillation process, preventing them from becoming part of the mash but still allowing their flavours to influence the mixture.</p>
